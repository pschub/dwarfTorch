Uses exponential time limit increase and incorporates 1Hz blinking led. To keep
the light on, the user must trigger the motion sensor at regular intervals no
more than timeLimit seconds apart. The previous version only gave users a fixed
15 second timeLimit, which was too difficult. The sensors weren't sensitive
enough to pick up quiet work in this time span. Version 2.0 gives users extra
time-to-trigger in the form of an exponentially growing timeLimit. Hopefully
this will improve the light conditions in the basement.

Version 1.0 - March 2012 
Takes inputs from pir sensor and turns on lights on motion.
Time on is set by define in main.h. Also sends out a bargraph of on-time
remaining to a si-po shift register.
